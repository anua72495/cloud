ARE WE IN LINE WITH YOUR BUDGET?
Although we have no fixed minimum in regards to the projects we work on, our best service is utilized through projects that require design and construction and with clients who are interested in achieving a beautiful, smart home as seamlessly and comfortably as possible. Every project is custom so we can design for your budget. Sometimes the scope of your project does not match your budget so we work to make the two work for you.

WILL WE FIT INTO YOUR TIMELINE?
Many homeowners are expecting to start their project in the very near future; however, it takes time to thoroughly plan for large remodeling projects to ensure that they are done efficiently and correctly. The timeline of each individual project varies due to many factors including scale and scope of the project, the permitting process, how quickly selections are made and a host of other considerations. Regardless, COOPER Design Build works diligently to complete each project on budget, on time and with exceptional quality and service.
